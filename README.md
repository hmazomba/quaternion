**Quaternion** is a look into the future. It is a thousand year plan to advance the human species while enabling the development of new species and the preservation of our Planet. We want to enable humans to live their dreams while contributing to safe and prosperous planet. We want to all live in society where the betterment of our home is put first. Our mission is to create a home for the inhabitants of our Planet. This plan starts with a simple yet noble idea: Don't be evil. Unlike Google, we will not let greed get the best of us. We are here because we want everyone to benefit, not a select few. We are the Anti-Capitalist. We do not want to destroy capitalism as that would mean we need to replace it with a system that does the same thing: the oppression and subjugation of the masses for the benefit of a few. We think this system is outdated. We want to create systems that enable innovation at mass scale. We want to free this Planet's mind. Every single being, from the lowly ant, to the Mighty Redwood. This 'paradiso' has to be realised.
